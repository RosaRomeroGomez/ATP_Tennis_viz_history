# ATP_Tennis_viz_history

This repository includes both all prototypes generated during the "ideation" process to create a visualization project around interesting tennis datasets and the source code for the visualization project itself.

<h2>Datasets</h2>

<p>ATP Tennis Rankings, Results, and Stats from https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp</p>

<h2>Ideation Process</h2>
<p>In what follows, there is a list of interesting research questions that the visualization project tries to address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of tour-level matches won and lost over time (1968-2017) by playing hand (Right, Left, Undefined)  
  https://github.com/RosaRomeroGomez/ATP_Tennis_viz_history/blob/master/prototypes/mirror_number_of_matches_per_year_player_hand.pdf</li>
  <li>Players' age distribution over time (1968-2017) by playing hand (Right, Left, Undefined)
  https://github.com/RosaRomeroGomez/ATP_Tennis_viz_history/blob/master/prototypes/number_of_matches_won_per_year_player_hand.pdf</li>
    <li>Players' age distribution over time (1968-2017) by playing hand (Right, Left, Undefined) (based on winner players)
